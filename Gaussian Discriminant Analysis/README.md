# Gaussian-Discriminant-Analysis
Gaussian Discriminant Analysis introduction and Python implementation from scratch

You can learn about mathematical background of the algorithms in [gaussian-discriminant-analysis.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skylab-air/Writings/main/Gaussian%20Discriminant%20Analysis/gaussian-discriminant-analysis.pdf). Implementation is in GaussianDiscriminantAnalysis.py. Applications of the algorithm to the real data are provided in GaussianDiscriminantAnalysis.ipynb.
